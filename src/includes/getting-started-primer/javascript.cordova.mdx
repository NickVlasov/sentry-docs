<Note>

_Sentry's Cordova SDK enables automatic reporting of errors, messages, and exceptions, and identifies performance issues in your application. The SDK is available on GitHub [`sentry-cordova`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cordova).

The Cordova SDK uses a native extension for iOS and Android, but will fall back to a pure JavaScript version (`@sentry/browser`) if needed. When you install `sentry-cordova`, the [Sentry Wizard](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) will help configure your project. We also add a build step to your Xcode project to upload debug symbols we need to symbolicate iOS crashes._

</Note>

Features:

- Automatic Native Crash [Error Tracking](/product/issues/) (using both `sentry-cocoa` & `sentry-android`)
- Offline storage of events
- Events [enriched](/platforms/javascript/guides/cordova/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- [Breadcrumbs](/javascript/guides/cordova/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/) created for location changes
- [Release Health](/product/releases/health/) tracks crash free users and sessions
- [Performance Monitoring](/product/performance/) creates transactions automatically
- Under the hood the SDK relies on our [JavaScript SDK](/platforms/javascript/), which makes all functions available for JavaScript also available in this SDK
- On device symbolication for JavaScript (in Debug)
- [Ionic support](/platforms/javascript/guides/cordova/ionic/)
